## BitLocker - Show Status on Drive (POC)

### Usage

* Download Visual Studio 2015 Community and build as Console application using C#. 
* For debugging purposes you need to run Visual Studio as an Administrator. 
* It's probably better to build target Release/Any CPU and then run bitlocker_poc.exe as an Administrator instead. 

### Example

* See the screenshot below with GUIDs removed:
